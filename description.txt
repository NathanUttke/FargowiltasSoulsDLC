Fargo's Soul Mod DLC
-This mod adds cross mod Enchantments and Souls for Thorium, Calamity, Shadows of Abbadon, and DragonBall Terraria
-Fargo's Soul Mod is required for this mod to work

NEW UPDATE - V 0.3.1
Removed Demon Blood Badge from Demon Blood Enchantment
Add Config Toggle for Snow Ruffian Wings

Tooltips of several Enchantments, nearly every Force, and the Soul of Yggdrasil now list the effects of all components. Translated tooltips are not changed, because I don't know Chinese and do not trust Google Translate enough to use that
Demon Blood Enchantment and upgrades no longer mention or use Demon Blood Badge, though no replacement item is included in the Enchant's recipe, as I do not know what item would fit best as a replacement (that's up to Fargo/Terry to decide)
Items which lost effects of components (such as Maestro Enchant losing Marching Band's Full Score effect) now include the effects of all components (including Soul of Yggdrasil- every item that had a return call while SoY was active no longer has that because it doesn't make sense to me)
Fixed Terrarium Enchantment and upgrades not summoning Terrarium Spirits even with the config option enabled (Terrarium Spirits' projectile IDs were changed in Thorium, which broke Terrarium Enchant)
